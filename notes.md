so using the testApp created as a test run to see if it could work with what i have with tokens... got it to work on login but got stuck with the reg and hadnt made enough of the app to test the users list api needing token in authorization headers and with only the admin role... admin user is joshua with pass: pass... funny right.. its currently the only admin so should be the only one to be able to access the rest of the list... unless it all goes away... remember maybe a good idea to create seeds to prevent kiling the database when i close then reopen and re-run.
